		p There is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when 		otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program “as is” 		without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied 		warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality 		and performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of 		all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
		
		p In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or 		any other party who modifies and/or conveys the program as permitted above, be liable to you for 		damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or 		inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered 		inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any 		other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages		.
		
		p If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal 		effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates 		an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program, unless a warranty or 		assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee.
